1. Implementation of fragments to all activities (including the post detail view)
2. Connecting like count and comments to Parse

## Notes

This was the first time using a server to build my own dataset to be used in the app, rather than an existing API. It was challenging to familiarize myself with the new methods to obtain and manipulate the data retrieved from Parse. Additionally, I found it difficult to improve the UI/UX of my application without tampering with the backend. Nonetheless, I feel that I learned and improved a lot in my front-end and back-end knowledge about Android mobile development from developing this Instagram application
